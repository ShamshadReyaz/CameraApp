# CameraApp
This project demonstrate the use of CameraX API for in-app face time.

You can click picture using main or front.

I have also used yalantis.ucrop library to perform some editing on clicked picture.

I have also shown how to perform onActivityResult which is deprecated by using registerForActivityResult.
